      <p>
        Hi. I'm Brian Sedely. I live in Winter Garden, Florida with my wife Lydia, my two sons Christian and Caleb, Manny the dog
        and Ellie the cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in Banking and Financial Services for nearly 13 years. I spent most of my time in various divisions of SunTrust,
        but as of 2014, I work for Seaside National Bank & Trust, a community bank headquartered in Orlando. The University
        of Central Florida is my alma mater (class of '07), as well as where I completed B-school (MBA class of '13).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy any kind of sport you can do behind a boat, especially wakeboarding. (I don't get to go frequent enough). I like
        music, both listening and playing music on guitar, bass, or drums.
      </p>
